# Matplotlib--Challenge
MatPlotLib--Challenge
For this challenge, we were given Pymaceutical Data about different drug regimens that were tested on mice. For the challenge, we needed to import the data and run several statistical analysis on the data set. These included finding the mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and SEM. We also needed to graph the data using a bar graph, a pie chart, and a scatter plot. We then found the regression line and graphed that information. Finally, we were tasked with finding the quartiles, IQR, and any outliers in the data set for the four specific drugs. We graphed this information on a box and whisker plot.
